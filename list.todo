First steps:
    ☐ Create one test
    ☐ Create the function that walks through this first test and make it a success

After that:
    ☐ Create tests for more complexes cases
    ☐ Change the function until those complex cases are fuffilled
    Complex cases:
        ☐ What about a really long pathway?
        ☐ What about a path that has more than one correct result?
